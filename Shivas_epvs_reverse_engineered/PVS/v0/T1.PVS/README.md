## The segmentation models

* PVS/v0/T1.PVS: is the segmentation model described in the publication
    * due to file size limitation the models can be found [here](https://cloud.efixia.com/sharing/dDqjx2DCq) : https://cloud.efixia.com/sharing/dDqjx2DCq
* PVS/v1/T1.PVS: is a segmentation model with incremental architecture enhancements done since the publication and is trained with a nonlinear voxel augmentation strategy that makes it more robust when used with degraded or resampled images.
    * due to file size limitation the models can be found [here](https://cloud.efixia.com/sharing/wknXOu07H) : https://cloud.efixia.com/sharing/wknXOu07H
* PVS/v1/T1-FLAIR.PVS: is a multimodal segmentation model with the same architecture as the one above, using FLAIR provides a small performance increase.
